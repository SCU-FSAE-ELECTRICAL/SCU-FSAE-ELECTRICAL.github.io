The SCU FSAE Electrical Team is part of the Bronco Racing Formula SAE program at Santa Clara University. We compete in the Formula SAE Electric competition, where we design and build a high-performance electric race car.

### Our Mission

To provide students with hands-on experience in automotive electrical engineering, fostering innovation, teamwork, and technical excellence in the development of electric race vehicles.

### Our History

Santa Clara University's Formula SAE program has a rich history of competitive success. The electrical team plays a crucial role in developing the electric powertrain, control systems, and safety features that make our vehicles competitive.

### What is Formula SAE?

Formula SAE is a student design competition organized by SAE International. Teams from around the world design, build, and race small formula-style vehicles. The competition evaluates not just speed, but also design, cost analysis, and business presentation.
